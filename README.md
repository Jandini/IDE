## Hard drive imaging through IDE ports for DOS

Written simple hard drive imaging tool using [Borland Pascal](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Borland_Pascal). I used [Turbo Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) library to create user interface. The software was communicating with hard drive directly via ports to [Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA#IDE_and_ATA-1). IDE allowed up to four hard drives only.

This was my last software written for DOS.
